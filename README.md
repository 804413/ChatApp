There two main tags in html one is head and another one is body
In head I gave title in that I gave title name as Task 2 which displayed on the top navbar when we open that in default browser.
And then CSS file is linked to the HTML by linktag.
Coming to body there are three sections (Section , section2 , section3).

Section
In section (header class) is created for styleing.   
img tag is used to place the logo.
unordered list is created inside ul LIst is created.
in section one i placed a H1 tag for heading and P tag for paragraph.

Section1
In section2 (heading class) is created.
I used H1 tag for heading and P tag for paragraph.
And an image is placed below the paragraph by img tag.
